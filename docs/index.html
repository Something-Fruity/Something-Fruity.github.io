                        <p>Something Fruity is a game designed and implemented to be used by children. It’s fun, and its simple interface gives children an easy gaming dashboard.
                               Its simplicity gives parents low involvement, meaning they don’t have to get involved every time their children need to play the game. It contains sound playing in the background as soon as the interface is engaged. 
                               It adds up the enjoyment of the games by the user. However, it is also designed with a single keypress option to mute the sound depending on the user preference. Furthermore, you will need an internet connection to run the program since it is a web-based

                           To do this, the user is required to provide personal details, including; username, forename, surname, password, and email. On this page, the dashboard presents two actions, login and account creation.
                           This is to cater to the users who already have an account and would like to proceed.</p>

						<h3 id="login">Login</h3>
						<p>As soon as the user or player has created their own account on the create an account dashboard, the user is directed to the login page, where you are prompted to enter the initial details, you registered with. 
                        On authentication (login and account creation), the game uses session cookies to represent the users’ sessions. In this manner, the player’s username is used to identify him/ her while playing the game or during an active session. When logging off, the session is simply terminated/ destroyed; 
                        hence the name disappears.</p>

                        <p>The interface shown above requires one to provide personal details as displayed, including the name and passwords. An authentication password is validated twice for security reasons. As such,
                        a password is suggested to be at least 8 characters with at least one UPPER CASE, ONE SPECIAL CHARACTERS, and a NUMBER.</P>

However, the username/ session ID is retained and sustained throughout the game along with the persona, 
                          which can be changed at any given time provided the user is still authenticated and an active user. </p>
