							<p>User documentation for the web-based game 'Something Fruity'.<br /></p>
							<p>Something Fruity is a game designed and implemented to be used by children. It’s fun, and its simple interface gives children an easy gaming dashboard. 
                               Its simplicity gives parents low involvement, meaning they don’t have to get involved every time their children need to play the game. It contains sound playing in the background as soon as the interface is engaged. 
                               It adds up the enjoyment of the games by the user. However, it is also designed with a single keypress option to mute the sound depending on the user preference. Furthermore, you will need an internet connection to run the program since it is a web-based

                  	<p>Before starting or playing the game, the user is prompted to register or log in in order to run the game. 
                       This is part of the security design of the system. It is mandatory for everyone who will be use the system:</p>
                    <p>To play/ use the game, one needs to have an active account in which their profile is saved as well as the game progress as part of the design. 
                       To do this, the user is required to provide personal details, including; username, forename, surname, password, and email. On this page, the dashboard presents two actions, login and account creation. 
                       This is to cater to the users who already have an account and would like to proceed.</p>

						<h3 id="">Login</h3>
						<p>As soon as the user or player has created their own account on the create an account dashboard, the user is directed to the login page, where you are prompted to enter the initial details, you registered with. 
                        On authentication (login and account creation), the game uses session cookies to represent the users’ sessions. In this manner, the player’s username is used to identify him/ her while playing the game or during an active session. When logging off, the session is simply terminated/ destroyed; 
                        hence the name disappears.</p>

                    <p>The interface shown above requires one to provide personal details as displayed, including the name and passwords. An authentication password is validated twice for security reasons. As such, 
                       a password is suggested to be at least 8 characters with at least one UPPER CASE, ONE SPECIAL CHARACTERS, and a NUMBER.</P>

						<p>After successful authentication, the users are provided with a dashboard to allow them to change/ edit their personal details. This also includes the delete functionality where all the player’s details and progress are deleted from the system once authorized to do so. This information can be retrieved on the account button, 
                        and the game button redirects to the actual playing canvas on the displayed navigation bar.</p>

						<p>The game progress can be saved on the game dashboard to be resumed later with the same session ID, 
                           the player’s username. In this case, the pause functionality temporarily halts the game, quit functionality cancels the game entirely.</p>

                       <p>Something Fruity allows the players to use fictional characters as personas for interactivity. In this way, the players can opt to use their own personal photos from the webcam or use the avatars provided in the game. However, the username/ session ID is retained and sustained throughout the game along with the persona, 
                          which can be changed at any given time provided the user is still authenticated and an active user. </p>

The sound can also be controlled using keyboard input where the keyboard’s mute key will mute the game as well as from the game’s

						<p>This is a feature in gaming that allows the players or the users from different physical locations to play or rather use the system. The players can therefore join a session while the channel is open. The player can also send invitations to other users to join their session. This makes use of the session IDs to identify the players uniquely. The multiplayer mode is facilitated by a button that, when pressed,
